Fine-tuned the hyperparameters and evaluated the model using key metrics, achieving an 85% precision and 80% recall. Projects Stock Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning | Finance Club, IIT Roorkee May 2024 - June 2024  Web-scraped Google news headlines, pre-processed the text and converted it into vectors using GloVe embeddings.  The vectors obtained were used to train LSTM model which predicted if the news headlines depicted a positive or negative sentiment and based on it predicted if the stock depicts a buy or sell signal, achieving 67% accuracy.  Obtained a portfolio value of $15,600.48 , sharpe ratio of 1.70 , -5.54 maximum drawdown and a total return of 5.6%. Duplicate Question Pair Detection | DOMS, IIT Roorkee October 2024 - November 2024  Designed a logistic regression model with TF-IDF and feature engineering on 40,000 question pairs to detect duplicates.  Applied PCA to reduce dimension to 2937 , achieving an accuracy and precision of 86% on the test dataset. Plastic Waste Management System | MIED, IIT Roorkee August 2024 - November 2024  Built a C++ algorithm to optimize recycled plastic allocation using vendor capacity, dispatch timing, and delivery dates.  Proposed to build a portal for communication between companies and recycling vendors and integrated incentive system to boost recycling. Mathematical Modelling of SortPuz (water sort puzzle) | DOMS, IIT Roorkee January 2025 - Present  Developing a recursion-based algorithm in C++ to play the water sort puzzle in the minimum number of steps.
